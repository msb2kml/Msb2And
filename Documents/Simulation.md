# Simulation

Instead of getting data from the Souffleur or from the MSB bus
of the receiver it is possible to replay a flight recorded
by the Flight Recorder or this application.  
This could be useful to check a configuration before a flight.

## Selection

The file used for the simulation is selected through a specialized
"file explorer" exactly like done for the Msb2Kml application.  
This file could be situated in the local storage noted
**"[\*Fixed\*]"** or from a remote storage noted as
**[\*Removable\*]"**.

## Monitoring

The data is presented to the application by steps of 0.5 seconds.

Beside the "**Stop**" button there is a "**Pause**" button.  
This gives you time to check the data displayed.

While paused, the "**Pause**" button changes to a "**Play**" button to
restart the simulation.  
However, before restarting you have the possibility to skip
some time from the simulated flight: 20 seconds, 2 minutes or 10 minutes.  
The skipped data is not processed by the application.

## Conformance

The data coming from the simulation is processed exactly like
the real time data.
