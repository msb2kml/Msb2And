# Installation

The application should be compiled from the sources of this
repository or downloaded from the ["Releases"](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2And/releases) pages.

The application package (Msb2AndXXX.apk) should be transferred 
to the storage of the device (such as Downloads).  
Selecting it with a File Manager should offer the opportunity to install it.

## Permissions

You need to have authorized the installation of applications
from other sources than Google Play.  
The application should have the permission to obtain the geographic
position from the GPS and the permission to read and write files.

## Accessory installations

Another application need to be installed to look at the track of the
flight on a topographic map: [Msb2Map](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2Map/)
from the same author. Minimum version of Msb2Map: 1.70.  
The application [Vtrk](https://github.com/msb2kml/Vtrk/) could be
used to put waypoints and draw routes on the map.


Other applications could be installed for a better experience.

Such as [DroidEdit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aor.droidedit) to edit the configuration file.
